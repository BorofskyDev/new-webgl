                <span class="gradient-text">2013 | </span> I began my career in banking and finance working for Wells
                Fargo in Raleigh, NC. Through hard work and great customer
                service, I was able to move to New York in 2016 as a Banker. While in New York I filled the roles of
                Banker I, Service
                Manager, Banker II, and Brokerage Associate (earning a Series 6 and 63).

                <span class="gradient-text">2019 | </span>Helped found SellSafe, LLC in Wichita, KS. A Software as a
                Service company, we sought to develop an app that would help small
                businesses make better-informed credit decisions. I helped secure initial funding, created the pitch
                deck, and worked
                with developers on creating a semi-functional prototype. It’s here that I discovered an interest in
                UI/UX.

            <p class="about__timeline--content" id="shadedImage">
                <span class="gradient-text">2020 | </span> Due to COVID putting a halt to investments, I sought out
                employment that would also give me some free time to help with
                family in Wichita. I was hired at Whole Foods and quickly was moved to a supervisor over customer
                service. During that
                time I also began to look more into software development. I signed up for Codecademy and I realized two
                things: 1 – I
                wanted to code and 2 – I had no idea what I was doing.
            </p>
            <p class="about__timeline--content" id="shadedImage">
                <span class="gradient-text">2021 | </span> I joined the coding bootcamp Coding Temple in October with
                the intention of going into data science. This seemed logical
                considering my background in finance and my love of data. However, while we only spent 3 of the 10 weeks
                on frontend
                development and 0 on UI/UX, I fell in love with frontend development. After graduating in January 2022 I
                knew only the
                bare minimum of how to code, but I knew one thing; I wanted to be a creative developer.

            <p class="about__timeline--content" id="shadedImage">
                <span class="gradient-text">PRESENT | </span> Since finishing bootcamp I’ve thrown myself into learning
                the basics (HTML/CSS/JS), looking over MDN documentation until
                the wee hours of the morning, and constantly rebuilding my own website as a way to learn. I’ve learned
                WebGL, Blender,
                React, React-Three-Fiber, and so on. While looking for work I’ve been throwing myself into learning,
                reading through
                ThreeJS’ amazing documentation, taking Bruno Simon’s Threejs-Journey course, moving away from tutorials
                and taking what
                I’ve learned and building my own stuff.</span>

                <span class="gradient-text">FUTURE | </span> The above 5 sections give a glimpse into my history, most
                of it centered around work. Each section describes how I got
                to where I am, how I drew off those experiences to move forward. At some point this 6th section will
                need to be updated
                with my first development job and how that company had an impact on me and helped to propel me forward.

                company be the 6th section?</span>
